# Tutorial to Create a Documentation Site Using MkDocs: Use Case with Synthea and Architecture on Amazon Web Services  
Creating a documentation site with MkDocs is ideal for documenting data solutions or machine learning projects. This tutorial will guide you in creating a site with organized documentation about the workflow for training a machine learning model using Synthea data. We will include charts, tables, and architecture examples to make the documentation complete and easy to understand.

## What is Documentation as Code?  
Documentation and its updates are a critical process in many companies that develop software, where this process is carried out using different tools, many of which are paid solutions.  
Therefore, in recent times, the concept of "doc as code" has emerged. This means using the same tools and workflow used in software development to manage, version, and deploy documentation.  
This approach not only allows for better tracking of the documentation but also facilitates its maintenance and ensures alignment with the same best practices used in software development, not just in the code but also in the documentation.
